<h3>Topic modelling</h3>

<p><b>Text collection</b> is set of documents, which of them is multiset of terms. <b>Terms</b> are elements of <b>vocanulary</b> &mdash; finite set W.

<p><b>Probabilistic topic model</b> is mathematical model that describes each document and each term
as discrete probabilistic distribution over set of topics T.

<p>To construct such distributions, one must represent matrix F of frequences of words in documents as product
of two matrices Φ and Θ. Then, columns of Φ will be distributions of words over topics, and rows of matrix Θ
will be distributions of documents over topics.</p>

<p>One of methods to do suh decompostion is ARTM (Additive Regularization of topic models). It is implemented in BigARTM open source libraryl</p>


<h3>VisARTM</h3>

<p>VisARTM is an interface for BigARTM. It's main purpose is visualizig topic models. It is aimed for two groups
of users: researchers who build topic models themselves and want to visualize them for research purposes and 
those users who want construct topic models without programming.
