<h1>Model creation</h1>

<h3>Automatic model creation</h3>
<p>For quick start, use built-in model builder.</p>

<p>
Go to <b>Datasets</b>, select dataset, click Create new model. 
Select tab Flat or Hierarchial, choose number of topcs and iterations and click Create.
</p>


<h3>Creating model with script</h3>

<p>
Go to Datasets, select dataset, click <b>Create new model</b>. 
Select tab <b>Empty</b> and click <b>Create</b>.
</p>

<p>VisARTM will create a folder and shows you full path to that folder. 
There you will find sample script named sample.py. 
This script will tell you, how initialize ARTM model with dataset, and where to put result.</p>


<p>For a flat model, result is two matrices theta and phi.
You should save them to folder of model, using to_pickle() methd of pandas.DataFrame.</p>

<p>When matrices are ready, just press Reload on page of model.</p>



<h3>Hierarchical models</h3>
<p>
If you are building N-tier hierarchy using hARTM, it is necessary to save also files psi1, psi2, ..., psi(N-1). Save them also using to_pickle(), next to theta and phi.
</p>




<h3>Multiple models</h3>

<p>
You can create another model. Just go to dataset page and click Create new model. 
You can delete model from page of models, or delete all models, using option Clear on dataset page. List of all models is available on the right of dataset page.
</p>
