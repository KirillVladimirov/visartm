<h1>How to create my own visualizer?</h1>

<p>General idea: you need to extract some data from model and store it as string.
Then you create an HTML file, in which this string will be inserted.</p>


<p>1. Choose name for your visualizer (further referred to as [name]);<p>

<p>2. Create file /algo/visualizatons/[name].py</p>
